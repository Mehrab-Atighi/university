# answer 
At the first we want to input our data to R:
```{r}
s<-factor(rep(1:4 ,each = 15))
v<-factor(rep(c(1:3) ,4 ,each = 5))
y1<-c(59.3,60.3,60.9,60.6,60.4,59.3,59.4,60.0,58.9,59.5,59.4,60.2,60.7,60.5,60.1,
      63.7,64.1,63.4,63.2,63.2,60.6,61.0,60.7,60.6,60.3,63.8,63.2,63.3,63.2,63.1,
      68.1,68.0,68.5,68.6,68.6,64.0,63.4,63.5,63.4,63.5,68.0,68.7,68.7,68.4,68.6,
      69.8,69.5,69.5,69.9,70.3,66.6,66.5,67.1,65.8,65.6,70.1,72.3,69.7,69.9,69.8)
y2<-c(4.5,4.5,5.3,5.8,6.0,6.7,4.8,5.1,5.8,4.8,5.1,5.3,6.4,7.1,7.8,5.4,5.4,5.4,5.3,
      5.0,6.8,6.5,6.8,7.1,6.0,5.7,6.1,6.0,5.9,5.4,3.4,2.9,3.3,3.1,3.3,3.6,3.9,3.7,
      3.7,4.1,3.7,3.5,3.8,3.5,3.4,1.4,1.3,1.3,1.3,1.1,1.8,1.7,1.7,1.8,1.9,1.7,0.7,
      1.5,1.3,1.4)
y3<-c(38.4,38.6,37.2,38.1,38.8,37.9,36.6,38.7,37.5,37.0,38.7,37,37.4,37,36.9,39.5,
      39.2,39.0,39,39,38.1,38.6,38.8,38.6,38.5,40.5,40.2,40,40,39.7,42.2,42.4,41.5,
      41.9,42.1,10.9,41.4,41.6,41.4,41.1,42.3,41.6,40.7,42.0,41.4,48.4,47.8,46.9,
      47.5,47.1,45.7,46.8,46.3,46.3,46.1,48.1,47.8,46.7,47.1,46.7)
y4<-c(295,302,318,345,325,275,290,295,296,330,299,315,304,302,308,271,284,281,291,
      270,248,264,257,260,261,282,284,291,299,295,280,284,286,284,268,233,248,244,
      266,244,293,284,277,299,285,265,247,231,268,247,205,239,230,235,220,253,249,
      226,248,236)
```
Now we make a data frame to see our data:

```{r}
Data<-data.frame(s,v,y1,y2,y3,y4)
head(Data)
tail(Data)
```

No we make our model with this hypothesis,we have 3 hypothesis here:
```{r}
response<-cbind(y1,y2,y3,y4)
result0<-manova(response~s*v)
summary(result0 , test = "Wilks")
```
According to the p-values<alpha=0.05, we can say that all of our treatments and s , v are
signifact with our response and all of the first hypothesis reject.
End.
