## Whats the emprical model?

### Definition
- The empirical model is a discrete distribution based on a sample of size $n$
that assigns probability $1/n$ to each data point.

## Example 4.7 

Consider a sample of size 8 in which the observed data points were 3, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7,
and 10. The empirical model then has probability function
\footnotesize
\begin{equation*}
p (x) =
\begin{cases}
0.125, &x=3\\
0.125, & x=5\\
0.375, & x=6\\
0.25, & x=7\\
0.125, & x=10
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
\normalsize

```{r , echo=TRUE , warning=FALSE}
c(1/8)
```

The empirical distribution is \textcolor{blue}{a data-dependent distribution}. Each data point contributes
probability \textcolor{blue}{$1/n$} to the probability function, so the $n$ parameters are the $n$ observations in the data set that produced the empirical distribution


## Visualizing Emperical Model in Example 4.7
\footnotesize
now we are going to plotting the Probability mass function (emperical model) that we illustrated in last slide (example 4.7 ).
```{r , echo=TRUE , warning=FALSE , out.height="68%" , out.width="100%"}
p = c(0,0,0.125,0,0.125,0.375,0.25,0,0,0.125)
barplot(p , col = c(0,0,1,0,1,2,3,0,0,1) , 
        names.arg = c(1:10) , xlab = "X Value" ,ylab = "Probability")
```
\normalsize

## Whats Kernel Smoothing Model?

Another example of a data-dependent model is the kernel smoothing model.\newline

### Definition

Rather than placing a probability mass of $1/n$ at
each data point, \textcolor{blue}{a continuous density function with area $1/n$ replaces the data point}. This piece is centered at the data point so that this model follows the data, but not perfectly. It provides some smoothing when compared to the empirical distribution. 

## Making a uniform Kernel Smoothing Model for Example 4.7 Data with bandwidth 2.

Now we are going to make a \textcolor{blue}{uniform kernel with bandwidth equal 2}.\newline

So we need to start with a good standpoint to understand the uniform Kernel smoothing models.\newline
We know that a \textcolor{purple}{uniform Distribution have \textcolor{blue}{equal probability} in all of that Domain}. and we know that when we are telling a \textcolor{purple}{bandwidth is equal to 2, it means that if we are in point x, we are speaking about this interval :\newline
\textcolor{blue}{$$ \forall x \in [x-2  , x + 2] $$}}.


## Making a uniform Kernel Smoothing Model for Example 4.7 Data with bandwidth 2 for Point x = 3

So if we want to plot a uniform kernel smoothing with bandwidth 2, just for point $x = 3$.\newline
it means that we want to \textcolor{blue}{distribute 0.125 to the $[1 , 5]$ interval.} that the probability in all of this interval is equal with each other and its equal to 
$$(1/4) * 0.125 = 0.03125$$
that 1/4 is the probability of a \textcolor{blue}{uniform distribution in an interval with length equal 4}. and the 0.125 is equal to a x = 3 probability that we distributed that in our interval.


## Plotting a distributed point x = 3 with new model

now we understand that $Pr(1 \leq x \leq 5) = 0.03125$, so we plot it.\newline

```{r , echo=TRUE , warning=FALSE, out.height="60%" , out.width="85%"}
p1_5 = rep(0.125/4 , 5)
barplot(p1_5 , col = c(2,2,1,2,2) , names.arg = 1:5 ,
        xlab = "X value" , ylab = "Probability")
```



## Making a uniform Kernel Smoothing Model for Example 4.7 Data with bandwidth 2 for Point x = 7

So if we want to plot a uniform kernel smoothing with bandwidth 2, just for point $x = 7$.\newline
it means that we want to \textcolor{blue}{distribute 0.25 to the $[5 , 9]$ interval.} that the probability in all of this interval is equal with each other and its equal to 
$$(1/4) * 0.25 = 0.0625$$
that 1/4 is the probability of a \textcolor{blue}{uniform distribution in an interval with length equal 4}. and the 0.25 is equal to a x = 7 probability that we distributed that in our interval.


## Plotting a distributed point x = 7 with new model

now we understand that $Pr(5 \leq x \leq 9) = 0.0625$, so we plot it.\newline

```{r , echo=TRUE , warning=FALSE, out.height="60%" , out.width="85%"}
p5_9 = rep(0.25/4 , 5)
barplot(p1_5 , col = c(2,2,1,2,2) , names.arg = 5:9 ,
        xlab = "X value" , ylab = "Probability")
```

## Uniform Kernel smoothing with bandwidth 2 formula

The probability density function is:\newline
\begin{equation*}
f(x) = \sum_{j = 1}^{5}{p(x_j)K_{j}(x)}
\end{equation*}
\newline
and we know that the uniform kernel smoothing with bandwidth 2, is :\newline
\begin{equation*}
K_j(x) = 
\begin{cases}
0 , &|x - x_j| > 2,\\
0.25, &|x - x_j| \leq 2
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}

where the sum is taken over the five points where the original model has positive
probability.

```


## Note

Note that both the kernel smoothing model and the empirical distribution can also be written as \textcolor{blue}{mixture distributions}. The reason why these models are classified separately is that \textcolor{blue}{the number of components relates to the sample size rather than to the phenomenon and its random variable}.
